## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

### Overview
This repo demonstrates the generation of a short news article on a given topic using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline with **Ollama, LangChain, and ChromaDB**. The workflow involves extracting text from PDF documents, segmenting the text into chunks, generating embeddings, storing them in a vector database, and performing similarity-based retrieval for query processing.


### What is RAG?

![](./images/rag.webp)
 - Retrieval (R): This involves searching for relevant data from external sources, databases, or knowledge repositories. The goal is to gather specific, accurate, and relevant information that can support or enhance the AI’s understanding of a particular topic or query.
- Augmentation (A): In this phase, the retrieved data is added to the prompt context. This means the information is integrated or combined with the input given to the AI, effectively enriching its knowledge base for better reasoning and context-aware responses.
- Generation (G): Finally, the AI uses the augmented context to generate outputs, such as text, explanations, or insights, based on the combined input and retrieved data. This step represents the output of generative AI tools like GPT models.

### Working of RAG

#### Data indexing

![](./images/index.webp)

This part focuses on preparing and managing the knowledge base during retrieval. Using **PDFPlumberLoader** (from LangChain_Community) to extract text from multiple PDF documents stored in a specified directory.The extracted text is divided into manageable chunks using **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** to facilitate efficient retrieval and processing. Each text chunk is embedded using the `nomic-embed-text` model. The embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, a vector database optimized for fast similarity searches.

#### Search and Generation

The user provides a query or question. The system begins by analysing this question for context and intent. Queries are processed by retrieving the most relevant text chunks from ChromaDB using similarity search. A relevance threshold is applied to ensure high-quality retrievals. These chunk serve as supporting evidence or context for generating an answer. The retrieved chunks are structured into a prompt for the LLM. The LLM processes the prompt, utilizing its generative capabilities to create a coherent and precise response. The response combines insights from the retrieved documents with the LLM’s pre-trained knowledge.

### Example results
The [dataset](./dataset/) consist of two documents each on covid-19, generative AI and climate change. Some results are shown below:

The Earth's Temperature is Rising: Understanding Climate Change

Climate change is a pressing issue that affects us all, and it's essential to understand its causes and consequences. According to scientists, climate change can be a natural process where temperature, rainfall, wind, and other elements vary over decades or more. However, today we are experiencing rapid warming from human activities, primarily due to burning fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gas emissions.

These greenhouse gas emissions act like a blanket wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide and methane, which come from burning fossil fuels such as gasoline for driving cars or coal for heating buildings. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide, while landfills for garbage are another source of emissions. The current level of greenhouse gas concentrations is at its highest in 2 million years.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice, sea-level rise, and changes in global climate patterns. This can contribute to the disappearance of scenic skiing and touring sites, as well as threaten small island states that may be submerged by rising sea levels. It's essential that we take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

### Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG refers to a more intelligent and dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation system where an “agent” plays a key role in orchestrating processes. The agent intelligently determines which resources or databases are most relevant for a user’s query, making it capable of handling more complex, multi-tasking scenarios. It is an evolution from traditional RAG systems, offering greater adaptability and decision-making by incorporating additional logic or heuristics into the retrieval and response generation pipeline. An example workflow is given below:

Here I have implemented a tool calling agent which either uses wikipedia for searching or retrieve relevant chunks of document from the ChromaDB. For example invoking the agent with topic `covid-19` used the retriever tool to generate the response as

"Surviving the Storm: Understanding COVID-19 and Its Devastating Impact"

The COVID-19 pandemic has left an indelible mark on humanity, affecting not only our physical health but also our social and economic well-being. The virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread globally, infecting millions of people and claiming thousands of lives. The impact of COVID-19 has been particularly devastating for vulnerable populations, including the poor, older adults, persons with disabilities, youth, and indigenous communities.

The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on these groups, exacerbating existing inequalities and poverty. The global response to the crisis requires coordination, solidarity, and effective socio-economic and public health policies to mitigate its effects. It is essential that we prioritize the needs of those most affected, ensuring they receive access to healthcare, social support, and economic opportunities.

As the world navigates this unprecedented challenge, it is crucial to understand the basics of COVID-19. The virus causes a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illnesses to severe respiratory distress. It can spread through sneezing and coughing droplets, making prevention and containment measures vital. By working together and staying informed, we can reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and build a stronger, more resilient future for all.

Here's a 3-paragraph article on Rohit Sharma:

The King of Cricket: Rohit Sharma's Unmatched Success

Rohit Sharma, born on April 30, 1987, is an Indian international cricketer and the captain of the Indian cricket team in Test and ODI formats. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. With his incredible skills and unmatched success, Rohit has become a household name in India and around the world.

Rohit's journey to becoming a cricketer was not an easy one. He started playing cricket at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks. He made his debut for Mumbai in 2008 and went on to play for the Indian national team in 2010. Since then, he has been a regular member of the team and has played in numerous international tournaments, including the ICC World Cup and the Champions Trophy.

Throughout his career, Rohit has achieved numerous milestones and broken records. He is the highest run-scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has also become the fastest batsman to reach 10,000 runs in international cricket. With his incredible talent and dedication, Rohit Sharma continues to be a force to be reckoned with in the world of cricket.

### Conclusion
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances LLMs by combining external data retrieval with generative capabilities, improving accuracy and relevance and reducing hallucinations. However, it struggles with complex, multi-step queries. Agentic RAG advances this by integrating intelligent agents that dynamically select tools, refine queries, and handle specialized tasks like code generation or visualizations. It supports multi-agent collaboration, ensuring adaptability, scalability, and precise context-aware responses. While traditional RAG suits basic Q&A and research, Agentic RAG excels in dynamic, data-intensive applications like real-time analysis and enterprise systems. Agentic RAG’s modularity and intelligence make it ideal for tackling complex tasks beyond the scope of traditional RAG systems.
